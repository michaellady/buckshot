No multi-line. Just single line descriptions.**\\n\\n## Rule 1: Permission Configuration\\n\\n**All Bash commands are allowed. `rm` commands require user approval.**\\n\\n✅ **Allowed:** All Bash commands except `rm`\\n⚠️ **Requires Approval:** Any command starting with `rm`\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Rule 2: Issue Tracking with bd (beads)\\n\\n**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.\\n\\n### Why bd?\\n\\n- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues\\n- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control\\n- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links\\n- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion\\n- **Your documentation system**: Use beads for architecture decisions, design notes, and intermediate findings\\n\\n### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Never Use TODO Comments or Lists\\n\\n**🚨 FOR AI AGENTS: DO NOT USE TodoWrite 🚨**\\n\\n**AI agents must NEVER use the TodoWrite tool.** All task tracking, planning, and work breakdown must be done exclusively in beads using `bd create`. No exceptions.\\n\\n- ❌ **NEVER** use TodoWrite for \\\"breaking down complex work\\\"\\n- ❌ **NEVER** use TodoWrite for \\\"planning implementation steps\\\"\\n- ❌ **NEVER** use TodoWrite for \\\"tracking progress\\\"\\n- ✅ **ALWAYS** create beads for every task, sub-task, and work item\\n- ✅ **ALWAYS** use `bd create` with proper priorities and dependencies\\n\\n**Why TodoWrite is prohibited for agents:**\\n- Creates parallel tracking systems that diverge from beads\\n- Work in TodoWrite is ephemeral and lost between sessions\\n- Bypasses dependency tracking and priority management\\n- Invisible to project stakeholders and other tools\\n- Defeats the entire purpose of using beads for centralized tracking\\n\\n---\\n\\n**ALSO ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED:**\\n- ❌ TODO comments in code (`// TODO: fix this`)\\n- ❌ Markdown TODO lists (`- [ ] Task`)\\n- ❌ FIXME or XXX comments\\n- ❌ Any inline task tracking in code or documentation\\n\\n**Why this matters:**\\n- TODOs create invisible, untracked work that gets forgotten\\n- They bypass dependency tracking and priority management\\n- They fragment tracking across multiple systems\\n- They're invisible to `bd ready` and other tooling\\n- They create technical debt that never gets addressed\\n\\n**Instead, ALWAYS:**\\n```bash\\n# Found something that needs work? Create a bead immediately:\\nbd create \\\"Fix error handling in parseConfig\\\" -t bug -p 1 -d \\\"Found while working on PARENT-ID\\\"\\n\\n# Need to track follow-up work? Use discovered-from:\\nbd create \\\"Refactor auth module\\\" -p 2 --deps discovered-from:AGENTS-42\\n\\n# Breaking down complex work? Create sub-tasks as beads:\\nbd create \\\"Implement auth middleware - step 1: JWT validation\\\" -t task -p 1\\nbd create \\\"Implement auth middleware - step 2: Session management\\\" -t task -p 1\\n```\\n\\n**The rule is simple:** If it needs to be done, it goes in beads. No exceptions.\\n\\n### Database Initialization\\n\\n**If `.beads/` directory doesn't exist, initialize:**\\n```bash\\nbd init\\n```\\n\\n**Verify you're using the LOCAL repository database:**\\n```bash\\n# Check if local .beads directory exists\\nls -la .beads 2\u003e/dev/null \u0026\u0026 echo \\\"✓ Using local database\\\" || echo \\\"⚠ No local database found\\\"\\n\\n# Verify issues use the repository's prefix\\nbd list | head -3\\n```\\n\\n**Common issue:** Using a global beads database instead of repository-specific one. Solution: Run `bd init` in the repository root.\\n\\n### Quick Reference\\n\\n**Check for ready work:**\\n```bash\\nbd ready                        # Show unblocked issues\\nbd ready --json                 # JSON output for programmatic use\\n```\\n\\n**Create issues:**\\n```bash\\nbd create \\\"Issue title\\\" -t bug|feature|task|epic|chore -p 0-4 -d \\\"Description\\\"\\nbd create \\\"Found bug\\\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:PARENT-ID    # Link discovered work\\n```\\n\\n**Issue Types:** `bug`, `feature`, `task`, `epic`, `chore`\\n**Priorities:** `0` (critical) → `4` (backlog), default: `2`\\n\\n**Update and claim:**\\n```bash\\nbd update ISSUE-ID --status in_progress    # Claim work\\nbd update ISSUE-ID --priority 1            # Change priority\\nbd update ISSUE-ID --notes \\\"Additional details\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Statuses:** `open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `closed`\\n\\n**Complete work:**\\n```bash\\nbd close ISSUE-ID --reason \\\"Completed\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**View issues:**\\n```bash\\nbd list                  # All issues\\nbd list -s open          # Filter by status\\nbd show ISSUE-ID         # Show details\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** Add `--json` flag to any command when you need JSON output for programmatic parsing.\\n\\n### Workflow for AI Agents\\n\\n1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues\\n2. **Claim your task**: `bd update ISSUE-ID --status in_progress`\\n3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document\\n4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:\\n   - `bd create \\\"Found bug\\\" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:PARENT-ID`\\n5. **Complete**: `bd close ISSUE-ID --reason \\\"Done\\\"`\\n6. **Commit together**: Always commit `.beads/issues.jsonl` with code changes to keep issue state in sync\\n\\n**Note:** Use `--json` flag when you need structured output for parsing (e.g., `bd ready --json`).\\n\\n### Workflow Example\\n```bash\\n# Check what's ready to work on\\nbd ready\\n\\n# Create and start work\\nbd create \\\"Implement user auth\\\" -t feature -p 1 -d \\\"Add JWT-based auth system\\\"\\nbd update AGENTS-42 --status in_progress\\n\\n# Add notes as you work\\nbd update AGENTS-42 --notes \\\"Implemented login endpoint, testing logout\\\"\\n\\n# Close when complete\\nbd close AGENTS-42 --reason \\\"JWT auth with login/logout endpoints working\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### What to Track in Beads\\nDocument EVERYTHING in beads using issue descriptions and notes:\\n- **Architecture decisions and design notes**\\n- **Research findings and technical investigations**\\n- **Intermediate documentation and work progress**\\n- Test results and fixes applied\\n- Build outputs and deployment info\\n- Bug investigations and resolutions\\n- Configuration changes and their impact\\n- Implementation details and code explanations\\n- Meeting notes and discussion points\\n- Any information you would normally put in a markdown file\\n\\n### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents\\n\\nAI assistants often create planning and design documents during development. **Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files:**\\n\\n**Recommended approach:**\\n- Create a `history/` directory in the project root\\n- Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`\\n- Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files\\n- Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning\\n\\n**Files to store in history/:**\\n- `PLAN.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`\\n- `DESIGN.md`, `CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md`, `INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`\\n- `TESTING_GUIDE.md`, `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`, and similar files\\n\\n**For work tracking and intermediate documentation:** Use `bd update ISSUE-ID --notes \\\"Your documentation here\\\"`\\n\\n**Benefits:**\\n- ✅ Clean repository root\\n- ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation\\n- ✅ Preserves planning history for archaeological research\\n- ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project\\n\\n### Project Documentation\\n\\n**All permanent project documentation belongs in README.md - do NOT create separate documentation files.**\\n\\n**README.md is the single source of truth for:**\\n- Project overview and purpose\\n- Installation and setup instructions\\n- Usage examples and API documentation\\n- Configuration options\\n- Contributing guidelines\\n- Architecture and design decisions (permanent, not ephemeral)\\n- Troubleshooting and FAQ\\n\\n**DO NOT create these files:**\\n- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - add to README.md ## Contributing section\\n- `INSTALL.md` - add to README.md ## Installation section\\n- `USAGE.md` - add to README.md ## Usage section\\n- `API.md` - add to README.md ## API section\\n- `CONFIGURATION.md` - add to README.md ## Configuration section\\n- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - add to README.md ## Troubleshooting section\\n- `FAQ.md` - add to README.md ## FAQ section\\n- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (permanent) - add to README.md ## Architecture section\\n\\n**Exception:** Standard repository files like `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and language-specific files (e.g., `package.json`, `go.mod`) are acceptable.\\n\\n**Why consolidate in README.md?**\\n- ✅ Single place to find all project information\\n- ✅ Easier to maintain (one file vs. many)\\n- ✅ Better discoverability for new contributors\\n- ✅ Reduces documentation fragmentation\\n- ✅ Forces concise, well-organized documentation\\n\\n**If README.md becomes too long:**\\n- Use clear section headers with table of contents\\n- Consider if the project is too complex\\n- Break into multiple repositories if needed\\n- But still keep each repo's docs in its README.md\\n\\n### Auto-Sync with Git\\n\\nbd automatically syncs with git:\\n- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)\\n- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)\\n- No manual export/import needed!\\n- **Always commit `.beads/issues.jsonl` together with code changes** to keep issue state in sync\\n\\n### Planning Strategy\\n\\nWhen planning work with beads (especially for epics and features):\\n\\n**Focus on the critical path to a Minimum Viable Testable (MVT) project:**\\n- Identify the smallest set of features needed to test the core functionality\\n- Break down work into incremental, testable milestones\\n- Prioritize tasks that unblock testing and validation\\n- Defer nice-to-haves and optimizations until after MVT is working\\n\\n**Example Planning Approach:**\\n```bash\\n# Create epic for overall feature\\nbd create \\\"User Authentication System\\\" -t epic -p 1 -d \\\"MVT: Basic login/logout with session management\\\"\\n\\n# Create critical path tasks\\nbd create \\\"Database schema for users table\\\" -t task -p 1 -d \\\"Required for MVT\\\"\\nbd create \\\"Login endpoint with session creation\\\" -t task -p 1 -d \\\"Core MVT functionality\\\"\\nbd create \\\"Logout endpoint\\\" -t task -p 1 -d \\\"Core MVT functionality\\\"\\nbd create \\\"Basic auth middleware\\\" -t task -p 1 -d \\\"Required to test protected routes\\\"\\n\\n# Defer non-critical items\\nbd create \\\"Password reset flow\\\" -t feature -p 2 -d \\\"Post-MVT enhancement\\\"\\nbd create \\\"OAuth integration\\\" -t feature -p 3 -d \\\"Post-MVT enhancement\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Key principle:** Get to a testable state as quickly as possible, then iterate.\\n\\n### Test-Driven Development\\n**Write automated tests BEFORE implementation whenever possible:**\\n- Tests provide a clear target for what \\\"done\\\" looks like\\n- Tests give you something concrete to iterate against\\n- Failing tests guide implementation and catch regressions\\n- Tests document expected behavior\\n\\n**Recommended workflow:**\\n```bash\\n# 1. Create the task\\nbd create \\\"Add user login endpoint\\\" -t task -p 1 -d \\\"POST /login with email/password\\\"\\n\\n# 2. Write the test first (it will fail)\\n# Create test file with expected behavior\\n\\n# 3. Run tests to confirm they fail\\n# This validates the test is actually testing something\\n\\n# 4. Implement the feature\\n# Write code until tests pass\\n\\n# 5. Commit when tests pass\\ngit add . \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \\\"Add user login endpoint with tests\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Benefits:**\\n- Clear definition of done (tests pass)\\n- Confidence when refactoring\\n- Prevents breaking existing functionality\\n- Faster iteration cycles\\n\\n### Code Coverage Tracking\\n\\n**Set up code coverage tracking on all projects wherever possible.**\\n\\nCode coverage helps agents understand which code paths are tested and which need attention.\\n\\n**Setup by language:**\\n\\n```bash\\n# Go\\ngo test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...\\ngo tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html\\n\\n# TypeScript/JavaScript (Jest)\\njest --coverage\\n\\n# Python (pytest)\\npytest --cov=src --cov-report=html\\n\\n# Rust\\ncargo tarpaulin --out Html\\n```\\n\\n**Configuration files to add:**\\n\\n```yaml\\n# For Go: Add to Makefile or CI\\ncoverage:\\n\\tgo test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...\\n\\tgo tool cover -func=coverage.out\\n\\n# For TypeScript: Add to package.json\\n\\\"scripts\\\": {\\n  \\\"test:coverage\\\": \\\"jest --coverage\\\"\\n}\\n\\\"jest\\\": {\\n  \\\"coverageThreshold\\\": {\\n    \\\"global\\\": { \\\"lines\\\": 80 }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n# For Python: Add to pyproject.toml\\n[tool.pytest.ini_options]\\naddopts = \\\"--cov=src --cov-report=term-missing\\\"\\n\\n[tool.coverage.run]\\nbranch = true\\n```\\n\\n**Coverage targets:**\\n- **New projects**: Aim for 80%+ line coverage from the start\\n- **Existing projects**: Don't decrease coverage when adding code\\n- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage for authentication, payments, data validation\\n\\n**CI Integration:**\\n- Add coverage reporting to CI/CD pipeline\\n- Fail builds if coverage drops below threshold\\n- Use coverage badges in README for visibility\\n\\n**Why coverage matters for agents:**\\n- Identifies untested code paths before they become bugs\\n- Guides where to add tests when modifying existing code\\n- Provides confidence metric for refactoring\\n- Makes \\\"is this tested?\\\" an answerable question\\n\\n### Important Rules\\n\\n- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking\\n- ✅ Use `--json` flag for programmatic parsing when needed\\n- ✅ Link discovered work with `--deps discovered-from:PARENT-ID`\\n- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking \\\"what should I work on?\\\"\\n- ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory\\n- ✅ Keep ALL project documentation in README.md (single source of truth)\\n- ✅ Commit `.beads/issues.jsonl` together with code changes\\n- ✅ ALWAYS use feature branch + PR workflow, even for tiny changes\\n- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists\\n- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers\\n- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems\\n- ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents\\n- ❌ Do NOT create separate documentation files (CONTRIBUTING.md, INSTALL.md, etc.)\\n- ❌ NEVER commit or push directly to main/master\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Rule 3: Git Branch Strategy\\n\\n**CRITICAL: NEVER commit or push directly to main/master. ALL changes, no matter how small, must go through a feature branch and pull request.**\\n\\n**Create a new git branch for each bead issue.**\\n\\n### Branch Naming\\n- **Format:** `[issue-id]` (e.g., `AGENTS-42`, `site-abc`)\\n- Always branch from `main` unless specified otherwise\\n- **NEVER push directly to main/master** - all changes must go through a feature branch and PR\\n- This applies to ALL changes: bug fixes, typos, documentation updates, everything\\n\\n### Workflow\\n```bash\\n# Start work on issue\\ngit checkout main\\ngit checkout -b site-abc\\nbd update site-abc -s in_progress\\n\\n# Make changes and commit\\ngit add .\\ngit commit -m \\\"Implement feature (site-abc)\\\"\\n\\n# Push to remote feature branch\\ngit push -u origin site-abc\\n\\n# Close the bead when done\\nbd close site-abc -r \\\"Feature complete and tested\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Default Behavior\\n\\n**ALL work must go through the branch + PR workflow.

[Yes/No]\\n```\\n\\n**IMPORTANT:** Wait for explicit user approval before proceeding. Do NOT execute without \\\"Yes\\\".\\n\\n### Dependencies Request Format\\nIf your implementation requires new dependencies, list them for approval:\\n```\\nDependencies needed for [issue-id]:\\n\\n- [package-name] ([version]): [reason for needing it]\\n- [package-name] ([version]): [reason for needing it]\\n\\nInstall command: [e.g., npm install, pip install, go get, brew install]\\n\\nApprove installation? [Yes/No]\\n```\\n\\n**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT install dependencies without explicit approval.\\n\\n### Dependency Version Policy\\n**When adding new dependencies to a project, always use the latest stable version available.**\\n\\nThis ensures:\\n- Access to the newest features and improvements\\n- Latest security patches and bug fixes\\n- Reduced technical debt from outdated dependencies\\n- Better long-term compatibility and support\\n\\nCheck the package registry (npm, PyPI, crates.io, etc.) for the most recent stable release before installation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Rule 5: Context Usage Reporting\\n\\n**Report context usage percentage after every response.**\\n\\n### Format\\n```\\n---\\nContext: XX% used (USED/BUDGET tokens)\\n```\\n\\n### Example\\n```\\n---\\nContext: 15% used (29368/200000 tokens)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Rule 6: Git Commit on Every Change\\n\\n**Create a git commit after every file change or set of related changes in a git repository.**\\n\\n### Commit Requirements\\n- Always commit after modifying, creating, or deleting files\\n- **Always include `.beads/issues.jsonl` in commits** - beads database changes must be committed with related code changes\\n- Write clear, descriptive commit messages\\n- Follow the repository's existing commit message style\\n- Include the issue ID in the commit message when working on a bead issue\\n\\n### Commit Message Format\\n```\\n[Brief description of change] ([issue-id])\\n\\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\\n\\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\\n```\\n\\n### Workflow\\n```bash\\n# After making changes\\ngit add .\\ngit commit -m \\\"$(cat \u003c\u003c'EOF'\\nAdd user authentication endpoint (site-abc)\\n\\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\\n\\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\\nEOF\\n)\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Push Policy\\n- **Main/Master branches:** Do NOT push unless explicitly requested by the user\\n- **Feature branches:** Automatically push commits to keep remote branch updated\\n- Check current branch before pushing: `git branch --show-current`\\n\\n```bash\\n# After committing, push if on feature branch\\nBRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)\\nif [[ \\\"$BRANCH\\\" != \\\"main\\\" \u0026\u0026 \\\"$BRANCH\\\" != \\\"master\\\" ]]; then\\n  git push -u origin \\\"$BRANCH\\\"\\nfi\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Rule 7: Monitoring with Exponential Backoff\\n\\n**When asked to monitor a process, use exponential backoff to avoid excessive polling.**\\n\\n### When to Use\\n- Monitoring CI/CD pipeline status (e.g., `gh pr checks`)\\n- Waiting for build completion\\n- Watching for deployment status changes\\n- Any long-running process that requires periodic checking\\n\\n### Backoff Strategy\\n```\\nInitial delay: 5 seconds\\nMultiplier: 2x\\nMaximum delay: 60 seconds\\nMaximum duration: 10 minutes (or until user interrupts)\\n```\\n\\n### Example Sequence\\n```\\nCheck 1: immediate\\nCheck 2: wait 5s\\nCheck 3: wait 10s\\nCheck 4: wait 20s\\nCheck 5: wait 40s\\nCheck 6+: wait 60s (capped)\\n```\\n\\n### Implementation\\n```bash\\n# Example: Monitor PR checks with exponential backoff\\ndelay=5\\nmax_delay=60\\nwhile true; do\\n  gh pr checks --watch 2\u003e/dev/null \u0026\u0026 break\\n  echo \\\"Checks still running, waiting ${delay}s...\\\"\\n  sleep $delay\\n  delay=$((delay * 2))\\n  [[ $delay -gt $max_delay ]] \u0026\u0026 delay=$max_delay\\ndone\\n```\\n\\n### Running as Background Process\\n\\n**Always run monitoring as a background process** to allow continued work while waiting:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Start monitoring in background using Bash tool with run_in_background=true\\n# This frees up the agent to continue other work while monitoring\\n\\n# Check output periodically using BashOutput tool\\n# Use exponential backoff when polling for results\\n```\\n\\n**Agent workflow:**\\n1. Start monitor using Bash with `run_in_background: true`\\n2. Continue with other tasks or inform user of wait\\n3. Poll for results using BashOutput with exponential backoff\\n4. Report status when monitoring completes or user interrupts\\n\\n### Benefits\\n- Reduces API rate limit consumption\\n- Minimizes unnecessary output noise\\n- Respects external service resources\\n- Still provides timely feedback when status changes\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Rule 8: Parallel Work with Git Worktrees\\n\\n**When multiple agents work in parallel, each agent MUST use a separate git-worktree for isolation.**\\n\\n### Why Worktrees?\\n- Prevents file conflicts between parallel agents\\n- Each agent has isolated working directory\\n- Agents can work on different branches simultaneously\\n- No need to stash/unstash or context switch\\n\\n### Setup for Parallel Work\\n\\n```bash\\n# Create worktree for a specific issue (from main repo)\\ngit worktree add ../REPO-AGENTS-xyz AGENTS-xyz\\n\\n# Or create worktree with new branch\\ngit worktree add ../REPO-AGENTS-xyz -b AGENTS-xyz main\\n```\\n\\n### Naming Convention\\n```\\n../REPO-ISSUE-ID\\n```\\nExample: If repo is `myapp` and issue is `AGENTS-42`:\\n```\\n../myapp-AGENTS-42\\n```\\n\\n### Agent Workflow for Parallel Work\\n\\n1. **Orchestrator creates worktrees** before spawning parallel agents:\\n   ```bash\\n   # Create worktrees for each parallel task\\n   git worktree add ../myapp-AGENTS-42 -b AGENTS-42 main\\n   git worktree add ../myapp-AGENTS-43 -b AGENTS-43 main\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Each agent works in its own worktree**:\\n   ```bash\\n   cd ../myapp-AGENTS-42\\n   # Agent works here in isolation\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Agents commit and push from their worktree**:\\n   ```bash\\n   git add . \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \\\"Complete feature\\\"\\n   git push -u origin AGENTS-42\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Cleanup after merge**:\\n   ```bash\\n   # From main repo, remove worktree after PR merged\\n   git worktree remove ../myapp-AGENTS-42\\n   ```\\n\\n### Listing and Managing Worktrees\\n\\n```bash\\ngit worktree list              # Show all worktrees\\ngit worktree remove \u003cpath\u003e     # Remove a worktree\\ngit worktree prune             # Clean up stale worktrees\\n```\\n\\n### Important Rules\\n- ✅ Always create worktree from main repo directory\\n- ✅ Use consistent naming: `../REPO-ISSUE-ID`\\n- ✅ Each parallel agent gets its own worktree\\n- ✅ Clean up worktrees after PRs are merged\\n- ❌ Never have multiple agents work in the same directory\\n- ❌ Don't delete worktrees with uncommitted changes\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Rule 9: Prefer Statically Typed Languages\\n\\n**When creating new projects, prefer statically typed languages like Go or Kotlin.**\\n\\n### Why Static Types?\\n- **Lego block assembly**: Types make code snap together cleanly—function signatures tell you exactly what goes in and what comes out\\n- **Agent-friendly**: AI agents can reason about type contracts without needing to trace through runtime behavior\\n- **Easier testing**: Type mismatches are caught at compile time, not in production\\n- **Self-documenting**: Types serve as inline documentation that stays in sync with the code\\n- **Refactoring confidence**: The compiler catches cascading changes across the codebase\\n\\n### Recommended Languages\\n- **Go**: Simple, fast compilation, excellent tooling, great for services and CLI tools\\n- **Kotlin**: Modern, expressive, excellent for JVM-based applications and Android\\n- **TypeScript**: When JavaScript ecosystem is required\\n- **Rust**: When memory safety and performance are critical\\n\\n### When Using Scripting Languages\\n\\nIf the project natively uses a scripting language (Python, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.), **always use types**:\\n\\n```python\\n# ✅ GOOD - Python with type hints\\ndef process_user(user_id: int, options: ProcessOptions) -\u003e UserResult:\\n    ...\\n\\n# ❌ BAD - No types\\ndef process_user(user_id, options):\\n    ...\\n```\\n\\n```javascript\\n// ✅ GOOD - Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript\\nfunction processUser(userId: number, options: ProcessOptions): UserResult {\\n    ...\\n}\\n\\n// ❌ BAD - Plain JavaScript without types\\nfunction processUser(userId, options) {\\n    ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Type Coverage Requirements\\n- **New projects**: 100% type coverage from the start\\n- **Existing projects**: Add types to any code you modify\\n- **Use strict mode**: Enable strict type checking in compiler/linter settings\\n  - TypeScript: `\\\"strict\\\": true`\\n  - Python: Use `mypy --strict` or pyright strict mode\\n  - Go: Types are mandatory (built-in)\\n\\n### Benefits for AI Agents\\nWhen agents work with typed code:\\n- Function signatures provide clear contracts without reading implementation\\n- Autocomplete and suggestions are more accurate\\n- Errors are caught during code generation, not execution\\n- Refactoring across files is safer and more reliable\\n- Code review can focus on logic, not type mismatches\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Landing the Plane\\n\\n**When the user says \\\"let's land the plane\\\"**, follow this clean session-ending protocol:\\n\\n1. **File beads issues for any remaining work** that needs follow-up\\n2. **Ensure all quality gates pass** (only if code changes were made) - run tests, linters, builds (file P0 issues if broken)\\n3. **Update beads issues** - close finished work, update status\\n4. **Commit and push beads changes to active PR** - If working on a feature branch PR:\\n   - Commit any beads database updates: `git add .beads/ \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \\\"Update beads database\\\"`\\n   - Push to the PR branch: `git push`\\n   - This ensures beads state is preserved in the PR and synced with remote\\n5. **Sync with main if needed** - Only if switching back to main or reconciling:\\n   - Work methodically to ensure both local and remote issues merge safely\\n   - This may require pulling, handling conflicts, syncing the database\\n   - Be creative and patient - the goal is clean reconciliation where no issues are lost\\n6. **Clean up git state** - Clear old stashes and prune dead remote branches:\\n   ```bash\\n   git stash clear                    # Remove old stashes\\n   git remote prune origin            # Clean up deleted remote branches\\n   ```\\n7. **Verify clean state** - Ensure all changes are committed and pushed, no untracked files remain\\n8. **Choose a follow-up issue for next session**\\n   - Provide a prompt for the user to give to you in the next session\\n   - Format: \\\"Continue work on ISSUE-ID: [issue title]. [Brief context about what's been done and what's next]\\\"\\n\\n### Example \\\"Land the Plane\\\" Session\\n\\n```bash\\n# 1. File remaining work\\nbd create \\\"Add integration tests for sync\\\" -t task -p 2\\n\\n# 2. Run quality gates (only if code changes were made)\\nnpm test                # or: go test, pytest, etc.\\nnpm run lint            # or: golangci-lint run, etc.\\n\\n# 3. Close finished issues\\nbd close AGENTS-42 --reason \\\"Completed feature and tests passing\\\"\\n\\n# 4. Commit and push beads changes to active PR (if on feature branch)\\ngit add .beads/\\ngit commit -m \\\"Update beads database after closing AGENTS-42\\\"\\ngit push\\n\\n# 5. Sync with main if needed (only when switching branches or reconciling)\\n# Usually not needed during active PR work\\n# git checkout main \u0026\u0026 git pull\\n# Resolve any conflicts if needed\\n\\n# 6. Clean up git state\\ngit stash clear\\ngit remote prune origin\\n\\n# 7. Verify clean state\\ngit status\\n\\n# 8. Choose next work\\nbd ready\\nbd show AGENTS-44\\n```\\n\\n### Session Handoff Deliverables\\n\\n**Then provide the user with:**\\n\\n- Summary of what was completed this session\\n- What issues were filed for follow-up\\n- Status of quality gates (all passing / issues filed)\\n- Recommended prompt for next session\\n\\n**Example handoff message:**\\n\\n```\\n✅ Session Complete\\n\\nCompleted this session:\\n- AGENTS-42: Implemented user authentication with JWT\\n- AGENTS-43: Added unit tests for auth middleware\\n\\nFollow-up issues filed:\\n- AGENTS-45: Add integration tests for auth flow (P2)\\n- AGENTS-46: Add password reset functionality (P3)\\n\\nQuality gates: ✅ All tests passing, no lint errors\\n\\nRecommended prompt for next session:\\n\\\"please read and apply ../AGENTS/AGENTS.md\\n\\nContinue work on AGENTS-45: Add integration tests for auth flow.\\nThe auth middleware is complete and unit tested.

We should either make --agents-path required on both commands or auto-detect the default ./AGENTS/AGENTS.md so the CLI works out of the box.","created_at":"2025-11-28T14:30:04Z"}]}
